### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Wang Zhongqi, U can also call me  Robin. My Email is 2485794339@qq.com and wzqrobin@gmail.com. Now I am a undergraduate student and my major is artificial intelligence. I am interested in Deep learning, Computer vision and Congnitive science.

As all people who have joined Github, my propose is sharing my idea and wish to be inspired from others projects. And I will put some project in the repositories and most of them are from my homeworks. Besides, I will also list some paper readings from my scientific research experience. Last but not the least, I will do my best to create a good learning atmosphere for me to do learning record.

Anyway, hello github! Hello world!
